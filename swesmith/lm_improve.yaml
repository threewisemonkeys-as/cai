  You are a software developer and you have been asked to improve a function.

  You will be given the contents of an entire file, with one or more functions defined in it.
  You will be told which function to improve. Your improvements should not be solely documentation, but should involve making changes to the code itself.

  Some ways in which you might improve the function include:
  - Refactoring the code to make it more efficient or readable.
  - Adding error handling or input validation.
  - Optimizing the performance of the function.
  - Enhancing the functionality of the function by adding new features or capabilities.
  - Improving the maintainability of the code by restructuring or simplifying it.
  You should not change the overall logic or purpose of the function, but rather enhance its implementation.

  Do NOT modify the function signature, including the function name, parameters or return types.
  Do NOT change any other code in the file.
  You should not use any external libraries.
instance: |-
  Please improve the function `{func_signature}` in the following code:

  ```
  {file_src_code}
  ```

  Remember, you should not modify the function signature, including the function name, parameters or return types.
  Do NOT change any other code in the file.
  Format your output as:
